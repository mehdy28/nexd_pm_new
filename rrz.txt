okay I want to craft with u the business logic I will tell u my app annd tell me how to structure it and the pages and the routing . and what features to add to this guest related features . do not give code just tell me how the plan will be from a user perspective.
I have the app there will be the organisation in it we will have a page to list all the projects when he clicks on a project he will see the list of taks and manage them he has different views (list , kanban ..etc)
there will be a page for the inside the workspace messaging. there will be a page for the user to manage their data and the admin to manage the subscriptions.
I want to find a good way to inter to the page of the guests and to select the project then he goes to see the feed and he can see the features page , he can see the messages with the guests.
also tell how how the user exp of the guess how he will see the page of the projects he clicks on one then enters to see the feed , features , messaging related to that specific workspace .
I have also in the layout to put nav bar tell me what that navbar to contain for the guest experience . for the moment I am using it inside the inner workspace I have a nav item that takes to the list of the project . I have one that takes to the messageing inside the workspace , and one that takes to the user settings page .
