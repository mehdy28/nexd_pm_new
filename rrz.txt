this is a prompt management system and am concerned about the hardcoding of the names of the modals and what models I should add and if a new modal appears should I add it manually .
my concern is about the prompt enhancement with the ai to enhance the prompt based on the model to get the best of it and with less token use.  so I send to the backend api the content of the prompt and the name of the model .
should I  make the model drop down selection a simple input and the user inputs the name or make it a drop down .
don't give code just tell me how the plan will be .
